A database of covid19 resource links

These are various links of online resources, collected in `data.json`.
The medicine, plasma etc. availability data is kept updated by themselves (the online resources)

It mainly includes the data from https://covid19rescue.netlify.app (Thanks to the developer 🙏)

### Types

Currently the data has these types of resources:

```json
[
    "beds",
    "central",
    "meal",
    "medicine",
    "news"
]
```

For the developers wanting to help through technology ❣
